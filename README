PURPOSE

A library to list GitHub downloads, delete them, and upload new downloads.


MOTIVATION

I'm development a Java build tool that will revolve around GitHub. One of the
desired outcomes is to use GitHub for artifacts hosting, skirting the confusion
of Maven repository management, by using GitHub downloads to host artifacts in
zip archives.

To ease publishing, I want to incorporate upload to GitHub downloads to my
builds, hence this library.

NOTES

The order of the network calls for upload was taken from Net::GitHub::Upload.

This libraries forgoes dependencies outside the Java API, so that it is easy to
adopt and integrate into your Java program.

Building a proper multipart/form-data body is not hard, and should not require
new dependencies, especially since the call is specific to Amazon S3, not
generalized file uploads to anywhere, so we can do without an HTTP comfort library.

The XML API responses are parsed using the W3 DOM, part of Java 1.5 onward.

Download listings are scraped from the XHTML downloads page of the given GitHub
project.  The XHTML download page is not well formed. It was not possible to
parse the XHTML without some form of forgiving HTML parser, so regexs it is.
